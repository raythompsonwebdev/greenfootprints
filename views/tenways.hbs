              <h1>1. Switch to 30°C</h1>
              <p>By switching your washing machine temperature to 30°C, you are saving energy and cutting
                your utility bills too.</p>
              <p> With the help of modern detergents, a lower setting will still provide excellent washing
                results and can save at least 40% of electrical energy.</p>

              <h1>4. Vermicomposting</h1>
              <p>A great way to reduce your carbon footprint is to keep worms as pets in your kitchen or
                if you are a little squeamish – in your garden. We aren’t kidding. Worms are an
                effective and eco-friendly
                way of composting hundreds of pounds of kitchen waste every year. </p>
              <p>They are said to be much faster than normal methods of composting. When green waste is
                properly composted at home, it doesn't give off methane, a gas which contributes to
                climate change.</p>
              <p>The leftover compost can then be used in gardens and to plant houseplants which in turn
                create oxygen. For tips on making your very own wormery, click here.</p>

              <h1>5. Turn electricals off standby</h1>
              <p>Couch potatoes who are too lazy to walk over to the TV and switch it off should know they
                are wasting money and energy. According to The Department of Energy and Climate Change
                (DECC), the average
                household wastes around £40 a year simply by leaving appliances on standby.</p>

              <h1>6. Collect rainwater</h1>
              <p>Protect the environment and save on your water bills by collecting water from your very
                own garden to water the plants, wash the car or even your hair in it.</p>
              <p> The average rainwater collection amount for a house with a 2,000-square-foot roof can be
                approximately 190,000 liters per year, depending on how much rain your area gets. Put a
                big bucket in your
                garden to collect the rain or install rainwater storage tanks.</p>
              <p>It will runoff the gutters on your roof and fall directly into the tank. You can even
                heat it up after – using lower temperatures of course!

              <h1>7. Keep mobile phones for longer</h1>
              <p>In a world ruled by technology, it is difficult not to be tempted by the latest shiny new
                iPhone or Blackberry with all the latest features.</p>
              <p> But the DECC suggests we can save on electrical waste by not replacing our mobile phones
                every year. They say most will work for at least five years. By recycling phones, you
                can help stop harmful
                chemicals getting into the environment rather than putting them with household rubbish.

              <h1>8. Grow your own food</h1>
              <p>Growing vegetables at home diminishes the need for transport required to get food to your
                table otherwise known as ‘food miles’. </p>
              <p>It also allows you to grow your food without the need for harmful and polluting
                chemicals. If you don’t have a garden, you can still grow some delicious vegetables in
                even the smallest of spaces
                such as a balcony or patio space.</p>
              <p>If keeping a vegetable patch is too much of an effort, you can reduce food miles and
                therefore your carbon footprint by buying local organic produce. As the distance food
                travels decreases, so
                does the need for processing and refrigeration to reduce spoilage.</p>

              <h1>9. Load up</h1>
              <p>When using your washing machine, or dish washer, run them with full loads. Do this and
                save water, electricity, and washing powder. Also avoid wasted energy from tumble drying
                by drying clothes
                outside or on indoor dryers.</p>

              <h1>10. Say no to plastic bags</h1>
              <p>Plastic bags are massive eco-villains. Their production contributes to air pollution and
                lots of energy consumption. One plastic bag can take an astonishing 1,000 years to
                decompose. </p>
              <p>If you haven’t already noticed, a number of retailers across the UK are charging for the
                use of plastic bags (usually 5p per bag) or encouraging shoppers to buy eco-friendly
                bags made of natural fibres
                to reuse over and over again.</p>
              <p>These schemes are set to reduce the amount of ‘white pollution’ as 17 billion plastic
                bags are issued in the UK everyday. </p>
              <p>If you are one of those people who rely on plastic bags, then reuse them to line your
                rubbish bins at home, rather than buying more polluting bin bags.</p>
