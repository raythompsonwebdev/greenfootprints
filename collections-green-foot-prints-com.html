                        <h1>Collections</h1>

                        <h3>Recycling and rubbish bin in a German railway station.</h3>

                        <p class="collection-text"> A number of different systems have been implemented to collect recyclable from the general waste stream. These systems lie along the spectrum of trade-off between public convenience and government ease and expense. The three main categories
                            of collection are "drop-off centres", "buy-back centres" and "curbside collection".</p>

                        <h3>Drop-off centres</h3>

                        <p class="collection-text">Drop off centres require the waste producer to carry the recyclable to a central location, either an installed or mobile collection station or the re-processing plant itself. They are the easiest type of collection to establish, but
                            suffer from low and unpredictable throughput.</p>

                        <h3>Buy-back centres</h3>

                        <p class="collection-text">Buy-back centres differ in that the cleaned recyclable are purchased, thus providing a clear incentive for use and creating a stable supply. The post-processed material can then be sold on, hopefully creating a profit. Unfortunately
                            government subsidies are necessary to make buy-back centres a viable enterprise, as according to the United States National Solid Wastes Management Association it costs on average US$50 to process a ton of material, which can only
                            be resold for US$30.</p>

                        <h3>Curbside collection</h3>

                        <p class="collection-text">Curbside collection encompasses many subtly different systems, which differ mostly on where in the process the recyclable are sorted and cleaned. The main categories are mixed waste collection, commingled recyclable and source separation.
                            A waste collection vehicle generally picks up the waste.</p>


                        <p class="collection-text">At one end of the spectrum is mixed waste collection, in which all recyclates are collected mixed in with the rest of the waste, and the desired material is then sorted out and cleaned at a central sorting facility. This results in
                            a large amount of recyclable waste, paper especially, being too soiled to reprocess, but has advantages as well: the city need not pay for a separate collection of recyclable and no public education is needed. Any changes to which
                            materials are recyclable is easy to accommodate as all sorting happens in a central location.</p>

                        <p class="collection-text">In a Commingled or single-stream system, all recyclable for collection are mixed but kept separate from other waste. This greatly reduces the need for post-collection cleaning but does require public education on what materials are
                            recyclable.</p>

                        <p class="collection-text">Source separation is the other extreme, where each material is cleaned and sorted prior to collection. This method requires the least post-collection sorting and produces the purest recyclates, but incurs additional operating costs
                            for collection of each separate material. An extensive public education program is also required, which must be successful if recyclable contamination is to be avoided.</p>


                        <h2>Sorting</h2>

                        <h3>Early sorting of recyclable materials</h3>

                        <p class="collection-text">Glass and plastic bottles in Poland. Once coming led recyclable are collected and delivered to a central collection facility, the different types of materials must be sorted. This is done in a series of stages, many of which involve automated processes such that a truck-load
                            of material can be fully sorted in less than an hour. Some plants can now sort the materials automatically, known as single-stream recycling. A 30 percent increase in recycling rates has been seen in the areas where these plants
                            exist.</p>

                        <p class="collection-text">Initially, the commingled recyclable are removed from the collection vehicle and placed on a conveyor belt spread out in a single layer. Large pieces of corrugated fibre board and plastic bags are removed by hand at this stage, as they
                            can cause later machinery to jam.</p>

                        <p class="collection-text">Next, automated machinery separates the recyclable by weight, splitting lighter paper and plastic from heavier glass and metal. Cardboard is removed from the mixed paper, and the most common types of plastic, PET (#1) and HDPE (#2),
                            are collected. This separation is usually done by hand, but has become automated in some sorting centers: a spectroscopic scanner is used to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic based on the absorbed wavelengths,
                            and subsequently divert each material into the proper collection channel.</p>

                        <p class="collection-text">Strong magnets are used to separate out ferrous metals, such as iron, steel, and tin-plated steel cans ("tin cans"). Non-ferrous metals are ejected by magnetic eddy currents in which a rotating magnetic field induces an electric current
                            around the aluminium cans, which in turn creates a magnetic eddy current inside the cans. This magnetic eddy current is repulsed by a large magnetic field, and the cans are ejected from the rest of the recyclate stream.</p>

                        <p class="collection-text">Finally, glass must be sorted by hand based on its color: brown, amber, green or clear.</p>

                        <h3>Recycling industrial waste</h3>


                        <p class="collection-text">Although many government programs are concentrated on recycling at home, a large portion of waste is generated by industry. The focus of many recycling programs done by industry is the cost-effectiveness of recycling. The ubiquitous
                            nature of cardboard packaging makes cardboard a commonly recycled waste product by companies that deal heavily in packaged goods, like retail stores, warehouses, and distributors of goods. Other industries deal in niche or specialized
                            products, depending on the nature of the waste materials that are present.</p>

                        <p class="collection-text">The glass, lumber, wood pulp, and paper manufacturers all deal directly in commonly recycled materials. However, old rubber tires may be collected and recycled by independent tire dealers for a profit.</p>

                        <p class="collection-text">Levels of metals recycling are generally low. In 2010, the International Resource Panel, hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) published reports on metal stocks that exist within society and their recycling rates.
                            The Panel reported that the increase in the use of metals during the 20th and into the 21st century has led to a substantial shift in metal stocks from below ground to use in applications within society above ground. For example,
                            the in-use stock of copper in the USA grew from 73 to 238 kg per capita between 1932 and 1999.</p>

                        <p class="collection-text">The report authors observed that, as metals are inherently recyclable, the metals stocks in society can serve as huge mines above ground. However, they found that the recycling rates of many metals are very low. The report warned that
                            the recycling rates of some rare metals used in applications such as mobile phones, battery packs for hybrid cars and fuel cells, are so low that unless future end-of-life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical
                            metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology.</p>

                        <p class="collection-text">The military recycles some metals. The U.S. Navy's Ship Disposal Program uses ship breaking to reclaim the steel of old vessels. Ships may also be sunk to create an artificial reef. Uranium is a very dense metal that has qualities
                            superior to lead and titanium for many military and industrial uses. The uranium left over from processing it into nuclear weapons and fuel for nuclear reactors is called depleted uranium, and it is used by all branches of the
                            U.S. military use for armour-piercing shells and shielding.</p>

                        <p class="collection-text">The construction industry may recycle concrete and old road surface pavement, selling their waste materials for profit.</p>

                        <p class="collection-text">Some industries, like the renewable energy industry and solar photovoltaic technology in particular, are being proactive in setting up recycling policies even before there is considerable volume to their waste streams, anticipating
                            future demand during their rapid growth</p>
