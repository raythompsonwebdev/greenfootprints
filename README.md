# GreenFootPrints

## Description

Web application is based on a website brief I was given to build a website from for a city and guilds exam in web design I took in 2012.

The task was that I was a member of a local recycling company "Green FootPrints " based in Essex and you have been asked to set up a simple website consisting of at least 3 pages to advertise what the company has to offer.

I was given a few guidelines outlining requirements. see [Website brief](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/id4hyokzhc3tddz8txtli/greenfootprints.com.pdf?rlkey=nhd3e3jbepaxba06mg87fkdpu&dl=0).

Greenfootprints.com is a single page web application built using react.

## Tools

- [React](https://react.js.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [StyleLint](https://stylelint.io/)
- [Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass)

Greenfootprints requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite).

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Usage

Start development server :-

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Run production build :

```sh
$ npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

To serve build to view locally enter the following in the terminal :

```sh
 serve -s build
```

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
