## History

This website is a html css website template built using 960grid. This website is based on a project I completed from a web design exam I took at East London Technology Training. See full website breif below:

### Scenario

You are a member of a local recycling company "Green FootPrints " based in Essex and you have
been asked to set up a simple website consisting of 3 pages to advertise what the company has to
offer.

The committee of the club have given a few guidelines outlining their requirements. They are as
follows:

* Each page should be accessible from another with a single click.

* The logo should be used on every page.

* The background colour should be a light green colour, you can choose a suitable green color from
the wheel.

* Text colour should be easily readable against the background.

* Hyperlinks should use colour code #015D37 where text links are used.

* Visited hyperlinks should use colour code # A6T6OLwhere text links are used They have confidence in your design abilities and trust your judgement with regards to layout, use of images etc. 

To assist you they have provided a small selection of images and representative text for each section of the company. Feel free to adapt the images or text or use other suitable alternatives that you have located taking into account any legal implications. Follow the instructions carefully to ensure that all tasks are completed.
