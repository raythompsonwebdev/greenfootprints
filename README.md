# GreenFootPrints

## Description

Web application is based on a website brief I was given to build a website from for a city and guilds exam in web design I took in 2012.

The task was that I was a member of a local recycling company "Green FootPrints " based in Essex and you have been asked to set up a simple website consisting of at least 3 pages to advertise what the company has to offer.

I was given a few guidelines outlining requirements. see [Website brief](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/id4hyokzhc3tddz8txtli/greenfootprints.com.pdf?rlkey=nhd3e3jbepaxba06mg87fkdpu&dl=0).

Greenfootprints.com is a single page web application built using react.

## Tools

- [React](https://react.js.org/)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)
- [Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass)

Greenfootprints requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Usage

Start development server :-

```sh
$ npm run start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Run production build :

```sh
$ npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

To serve build to view locally enter the following in the terminal :

```sh
 serve -s build
```

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

( please note production build not currently working - will be fixed very soon)

```sh
$ npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
