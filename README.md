# GreenFootPrints

## Description

Web application is based on a website brief I was given to build a website from for a city and guilds exam in web design I took in 2012. I used Javascript Starter Kit by Cory House from Pluralsight video tutorial as starter point and updated packages.

The task was that I was a member of a local recycling company "Green FootPrints " based in Essex and you have been asked to set up a simple website consisting of 3 pages to advertise what the company has to offer.

I was given a few guidelines outlining requirements. see [Website brief](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qWS7W83edL72MfMZc3ILgJejs1nAV3ft).

Greenfootprints.com is a single page web application built using coding languages HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Web application has a ES6 module design pattern that allows additional functionality to be added easliy.
