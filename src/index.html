          <p>A large percentage of UK household’s still do not recycle enough and throw everything that they
            consider ‘rubbish’ into their ordinary bin. Much of this waste can be recycled and should be
            disposed of separately to general household waste. Look inside this rubbish bin to see how much
            of the contents should actually have been recycled. Check our list on the right to see how to

          <h2>Where can you recycle? </h2>
          
          <p>As well as home recycling bins, there are many recycling banks across the UK that can be used to recycle different materials. They are located on streets across the UK as well as in
            supermarkets and outside housing estates. </p>
            
            <p> Most recycling banks are emptied on a regular  basis. However, if you do come across one that is over-flowing, contact your local council who will arrange for the bank to be emptied. You can also contact your local council to report vandalism to the recycle banks.</p>

        <h1>Recycling consumer waste</h1>

        <article class="text">         

          <p>Recycling is processing used materials (waste) into new products to prevent waste of potentially
            useful materials, reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, reduce energy usage, reduce air
            pollution (from incineration) - and water pollution (from landfilling) by reducing the need for
            "conventional" waste disposal, and lower greenhouse gas emissions as compared to virgin
            production.</p>
            
            <p> Recycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third
            component of the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle" waste hierarchy. There are some ISO standards relating
            to recycling such as ISO 15270:2008 for plastics waste and ISO 14001:2004 for environmental
            management control of recycling practice.</p>
      

          <p>Recyclable materials include many kinds of glass, paper, metal, plastic, textiles, and
            electronics. Although similar in effect, the composting or other reuse of biodegradable waste –
            such as food or garden waste – is not typically considered recycling. </p>
            
            <p>Materials to be
            recycled are either brought to a collection center or picked up from the curbside, then sorted,
            cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials bound for manufacturing. In the strictest sense,
            recycling of a material would produce a fresh supply of the same material—for example, used
            office paper would be converted into new office paper, or used foamed polystyrene into new
            polystyrene. </p>

          <p> However, this is often difficult or too expensive (compared with producing the same product from
            raw materials or other sources), so "recycling" of many products or materials involves their
            reuse in producing different materials (e.g., paperboard) instead.
            Another form of recycling is the salvage of certain materials from complex products, either due
            to their intrinsic value (e.g., lead from car batteries, or gold from computer components), or
            due to their hazardous nature (e.g., removal and reuse of mercury from various items).</p>

 
          <p>Critics dispute the net economic and environmental benefits of recycling over its costs, and
            suggest that proponents of recycling often make matters worse and suffer from confirmation bias.
            Specifically, critics argue that the costs and energy used in collection and transportation
            detract from (and outweigh) the costs and energy saved in the production process; also that the
            jobs produced by the recycling industry can be a poor trade for the jobs lost in logging,
            mining, and other industries associated with virgin production; and that materials such as paper
            pulp can only be recycled a few times before material degradation prevents further
            recycling.Proponents of recycling dispute each of these claims, and the validity of arguments
            from both sides has led to enduring controversy.</p>

              <h1 class="collections_title">Recycling and rubbish bin in a German railway station.</h1>

              <p class="collection-text"> A number of different systems have been implemented to collect recyclates from
                the general waste stream. These systems lie along the spectrum of trade-off between public convenience
                and government ease and expense. The three main categories of collection are "drop-off centres",
                "buy-back centres" and "curbside collection".</p>
            </article>
            <article class="collection-box fade">
              <h1 class="collections_title">Drop-off centres</h1>

              <p class="collection-text">Drop off centres require the waste producer to carry the recyclates to a
                central location, either an installed or mobile collection station or the reprocessing plant itself.
                They are the easiest type of collection to establish, but suffer from low and unpredictable throughput.
              </p>
            </article>
            <article class="collection-box fade">
              <h1 class="collections_title">Curbside collection</h1>

              <p class="collection-text">Curbside collection encompasses many subtly different systems,which differ
                mostly on where in the process the recyclates are sorted and cleaned. The main categories are mixed
                waste collection, commingled recyclables and source separation. A waste collection vehicle generally
                picks up the waste.</p>


              <p class="collection-text">At one end of the spectrum is mixed waste collection, in which all recyclates
                are collected mixed in with the rest of the waste, and the desired material is then sorted out and
                cleaned at a central sorting facility. This results in a large amount ofrecyclable waste, paper
                especially, being too soiled to reprocess, but has advantages as well: the city need not pay for a
                separate collection of recyclates and no public education is needed. Any changes to which materials are
                recyclable is easy to accommodate as all sorting happens in a central location.
              </p>

            <article class="collection-box fade">
                <h1 class="collections_title">Curbside collection...</h1>
            <p class="collection-text">In a Commingled or single-stream system, all recyclables for collection are
                mixed but kept separate from other waste. This greatly reduces the need for post-collection cleaning but
                does require public education on what materials are recyclable.</p>

              <p class="collection-text">Source separation is the other extreme, where each material is cleaned and
                sorted prior to collection. This method requires the least post-collection sorting and produces the
                purest recyclates, but incurs additional operating costs for collection of each separate material. An
                extensive public education program is also required, which must be successful if recyclate contamination
                is to be avoided.</p>

            <article class="collection-box fade">
              <h1 class="collections_title">Buy-back centres</h1>

              <p class="collection-text">Buy-back centres differ in that the cleaned recyclates are purchased, thus
                providing a clear incentive for use and creating a stable supply. The post-processed material can then
                be sold on, hopefully creating a profit. Unfortunately government subsidies are necessary to make
                buy-back centres a viable enterprise, as according to the United States National Solid Wastes Management
                Association it costs on average US$50 to process a ton of material, which can only be resold for US$30.

              <h1 class="collections_title">Early sorting of recyclable materials: </h1>

              <p class="collection-text">Glass and plastic bottles in Poland. Once commingled recyclates are collected
                and delivered to a central collection facility, the different types of materials must be sorted. This is
                done in a series of stages, many of which involve automated processes such that a truck-load of material
                can be fully sorted in less than an hour. Some plants can now sort the materials automatically, known as
                single-stream recycling. A 30 percent increase in recycling rates has been seen in the areas where these
                plants exist.</p>

              <p class="collection-text">Initially, the commingled recyclates are removed from the collection vehicle
                and placed on a conveyor belt spread out in a single layer. Large pieces of corrugated fiberboard and
                plastic bags are removed by hand at this stage, as they can cause later machinery to jam.</p>

              <p class="collection-text">Next, automated machinery separates the recyclates by weight, splitting lighter
                paper and plastic from heavier glass and metal. Cardboard is removed from the mixed paper, and the most
                common types of plastic, PET (#1) and HDPE (#2), are collected. This separation is usually done by hand,
                but has become automated in some sorting centers: a spectroscopic scanner is used to differentiate
                between different types of paper and plastic based on the absorbed wavelengths, and subsequently divert
                each material into the proper collection channel.</p>

              <p class="collection-text">Strong magnets are used to separate out ferrous metals, such as iron, steel,
                and tin-plated steel cans ("tin cans"). Non-ferrous metals are ejected by magnetic eddy currents in
                which a rotating magnetic field induces an electric current around the aluminium cans, which in turn
                creates a magnetic eddy current inside the cans. This magnetic eddy current is repulsed by a large
                magnetic field, and the cans are ejected from the rest of the recyclate stream. Finally, glass must be
                sorted by hand based on its color: brown, amber, green or clear.</p>

              <h1>4. Vermicomposting</h1>
              <p>A great way to reduce your carbon footprint is to keep worms as pets in your kitchen or
                if you are a little squeamish – in your garden. We aren’t kidding. Worms are an
                effective and eco-friendly
                way of composting hundreds of pounds of kitchen waste every year. </p>
              <p>They are said to be much faster than normal methods of composting. When green waste is
                properly composted at home, it doesn't give off methane, a gas which contributes to
                climate change.</p>
              <p>The leftover compost can then be used in gardens and to plant houseplants which in turn
                create oxygen. For tips on making your very own wormery, click here.</p>

              <p>Protect the environment and save on your water bills by collecting water from your very
                own garden to water the plants, wash the car or even your hair in it.</p>
              <p> The average rainwater collection amount for a house with a 2,000-square-foot roof can be
                approximately 190,000 liters per year, depending on how much rain your area gets. Put a
                big bucket in your
                garden to collect the rain or install rainwater storage tanks.</p>
              <p>It will runoff the gutters on your roof and fall directly into the tank. You can even
                heat it up after – using lower temperatures of course!

              <p> But the DECC suggests we can save on electrical waste by not replacing our mobile phones

              <h1>8. Grow your own food</h1>
              <p>Growing vegetables at home diminishes the need for transport required to get food to your
                table otherwise known as ‘food miles’. </p>
              <p>It also allows you to grow your food without the need for harmful and polluting
                chemicals. If you don’t have a garden, you can still grow some delicious vegetables in

              <p>If keeping a vegetable patch is too much of an effort, you can reduce food miles and
                therefore your carbon footprint by buying local organic produce. As the distance food
                travels decreases, so
                does the need for processing and refrigeration to reduce spoilage.</p>

              <h1>10. Say no to plastic bags</h1>
              <p>Plastic bags are massive eco-villains. Their production contributes to air pollution and
                lots of energy consumption. One plastic bag can take an astonishing 1,000 years to
                decompose. </p>
              <p>If you haven’t already noticed, a number of retailers across the UK are charging for the
                use of plastic bags (usually 5p per bag) or encouraging shoppers to buy eco-friendly
                bags made of natural fibres
                to reuse over and over again.</p>
              <p>These schemes are set to reduce the amount of ‘white pollution’ as 17 billion plastic
                bags are issued in the UK everyday. </p>
              <p>If you are one of those people who rely on plastic bags, then reuse them to line your
                rubbish bins at home, rather than buying more polluting bin bags.</p>

              <p>
                  UK households produced 30.5 million tonnes of waste in 2003/04, of which 17% was collected or recycling (source: defra.gov.uk). This figure is still quite low compared to some of our neighbouring EU             countries, some recycling over 50% of their waste. There is still a
                  great deal of waste which could be recycled that ends up in landfill sites which is harmful to the environment. Recycling is an excellent way of saving energy and conserving the
                  environment.

              <ul>
                
                <li>
                  275,000 tonnes of plastic are used each year in the UK, that’s
                  about 15 million bottles per day.

                </li>
                <li>
                  Most families throw away about 40kg of plastic per year, which
                  could otherwise be recycled.

                </li>
                <li>
                  The use of plastic in Western Europe is growing about 4% each
                  year.

                </li>
                <li>
                  Plastic can take up to 500 years to decompose.
