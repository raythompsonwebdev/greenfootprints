                    <p>Recycling can sometimes be confusing and it can be difficult to know whether you are following all the right rules. Improve your recycling efforts by learning some recycling etiquette rules and check out which type of collection is
                        best and why different areas recycle and collect in different ways.</p>

                    <h2>What’s in your Rubbish Bin? </h2>

                    <p>A large percentage of UK household’s still do not recycle enough and throw everything that they consider ‘rubbish’ into their ordinary bin. Much of this waste can be recycled and should be disposed of separately to general household waste. Look inside this rubbish bin to see how much of the contents should actually have been recycled. Check our list on the right to see
                        how to recycle different materials.</p>
                    <br/>

                    <h2>Where can you recycle?  </h2>

                    <p>As well as home recycling bins, there are many recycling banks across the UK that can be used to recycle different materials. They are located on streets across the UK as well as in supermarkets and outside housing estates. <br/> Most recycling banks are emptied on a regular basis. However, if you do come across one that is over-flowing, contact your local council who will arrange for the bank to be emptied. You can also contact your local council to report
                        vandalism to the recycle banks. To find out where your local recycling bank is or if you want to know which materials can be recycled where, check the recycling point search <a href="">here</a>.</p>

                    <h1>Recycling consumer waste</h1>

                    <p>Recycling is processing used materials (waste) into new products to prevent waste of potentially useful materials, reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, reduce energy usage, reduce air pollution (from incineration) - and water pollution (from landfilling) by reducing the need for "conventional" waste disposal, and lower greenhouse gas emissions as compared to virgin production.<br/> Recycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third component of the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle" waste hierarchy. There are some ISO standards relating to recycling such as ISO 15270:2008 for plastics waste and ISO 14001:2004 for environmental management control of recycling practice.</p>
                    <figure class="recycle_img"><img src="images/recycle-image-green-foot-prints-com-large.png" alt="family-recyling-green-foot-prints-com" /></figure>

                    <p>Recyclable materials include many kinds of glass, paper, metal, plastic, textiles, and electronics. Although similar in effect, the composting or other reuse of biodegradable waste – such as food or garden waste – is not typically considered recycling. <br/>Materials to be recycled are either brought to a collection center or picked up from the curbside, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials bound for manufacturing. In the strictest sense, recycling of a material would produce a fresh supply of the same material—for example, used office paper would be converted into new office paper, or used foamed polystyrene into new polystyrene. </p>

                    <p> However, this is often difficult or too expensive (compared with producing the same product from raw materials or other sources), so "recycling" of many products or materials involves their reuse in producing different materials (e.g., paperboard) instead.
                    Another form of recycling is the salvage of certain materials from complex products, either due to their intrinsic value (e.g., lead from car batteries, or gold from computer components), or due to their hazardous nature (e.g., removal and reuse of mercury from various items).</p>

                    <figure class="recycle_img"><img src="images/challenge-award-2011-green-foot-prints-com-large.gif" alt="family-recyling-green-foot-prints-com" /></figure>
                    <p>Critics dispute the net economic and environmental benefits of recycling over its costs, and suggest that proponents of recycling often make matters worse and suffer from confirmation bias. </p>
                    
                    <p>Specifically, critics argue that the costs and energy used in collection and transportation detract from (and outweigh) the costs and energy saved in the production process; also that the jobs produced by the recycling industry can be a poor trade for the jobs lost in logging, mining, and other industries associated with virgin production; and that materials such as paper pulp can only be recycled a few times before material degradation prevents further recycling.
                    </p>
                    <p>Proponents of recycling dispute each of these claims, and the validity of arguments from both sides has led to enduring controversy.</p>

               <h1>Collections</h1>

                    <h3>Recycling and rubbish bin in a German railway station.</h3>

                    <p class="collection-text"> A number of different systems have been implemented to collect recyclates from the general waste stream. These systems lie along the spectrum of trade-off between public convenience and government ease and expense. The three main categories
                        of collection are "drop-off centres", "buy-back centres" and "curbside collection".</p>

                    <h3>Drop-off centres</h3>

                    <p class="collection-text">Drop off centres require the waste producer to carry the recyclates to a central location, either an installed or mobile collection station or the reprocessing plant itself. They are the easiest type of collection to establish, but
                        suffer from low and unpredictable throughput.</p>

                    <h3>Buy-back centres</h3>

                    <p class="collection-text">Buy-back centres differ in that the cleaned recyclates are purchased, thus providing a clear incentive for use and creating a stable supply. The post-processed material can then be sold on, hopefully creating a profit. Unfortunately
                        government subsidies are necessary to make buy-back centres a viable enterprise, as according to the United States National Solid Wastes Management Association it costs on average US$50 to process a ton of material, which can only
                        be resold for US$30.</p>

                    <h3>Curbside collection</h3>

                    <p class="collection-text">Curbside collection encompasses many subtly different systems, which differ mostly on where in the process the recyclates are sorted and cleaned. The main categories are mixed waste collection, commingled recyclables and source separation.
                        A waste collection vehicle generally picks up the waste.</p>


                    <p class="collection-text">At one end of the spectrum is mixed waste collection, in which all recyclates are collected mixed in with the rest of the waste, and the desired material is then sorted out and cleaned at a central sorting facility. This results in
                        a large amount of recyclable waste, paper especially, being too soiled to reprocess, but has advantages as well: the city need not pay for a separate collection of recyclates and no public education is needed. Any changes to which
                        materials are recyclable is easy to accommodate as all sorting happens in a central location.</p>

                    <p class="collection-text">In a Commingled or single-stream system, all recyclables for collection are mixed but kept separate from other waste. This greatly reduces the need for post-collection cleaning but does require public education on what materials are
                        recyclable.</p>

                    <p class="collection-text">Source separation is the other extreme, where each material is cleaned and sorted prior to collection. This method requires the least post-collection sorting and produces the purest recyclates, but incurs additional operating costs
                        for collection of each separate material. An extensive public education program is also required, which must be successful if recyclate contamination is to be avoided.</p>


                    <h1>Sorting</h1>

                    <h3>Early sorting of recyclable materials: </h3>

                    <p class="collection-text">Glass and plastic bottles in Poland. Once commingled recyclates are collected and delivered to a central collection facility, the different types of materials must be sorted. This is done in a series of stages, many of which involve automated processes such that a truck-load
                        of material can be fully sorted in less than an hour. Some plants can now sort the materials automatically, known as single-stream recycling. A 30 percent increase in recycling rates has been seen in the areas where these plants
                        exist.</p>

                    <p class="collection-text">Initially, the commingled recyclates are removed from the collection vehicle and placed on a conveyor belt spread out in a single layer. Large pieces of corrugated fiberboard and plastic bags are removed by hand at this stage, as they
                        can cause later machinery to jam.</p>

                    <p class="collection-text">Next, automated machinery separates the recyclates by weight, splitting lighter paper and plastic from heavier glass and metal. Cardboard is removed from the mixed paper, and the most common types of plastic, PET (#1) and HDPE (#2),
                        are collected. This separation is usually done by hand, but has become automated in some sorting centers: a spectroscopic scanner is used to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic based on the absorbed wavelengths,
                        and subsequently divert each material into the proper collection channel.</p>

                    <p class="collection-text">Strong magnets are used to separate out ferrous metals, such as iron, steel, and tin-plated steel cans ("tin cans"). Non-ferrous metals are ejected by magnetic eddy currents in which a rotating magnetic field induces an electric current
                        around the aluminium cans, which in turn creates a magnetic eddy current inside the cans. This magnetic eddy current is repulsed by a large magnetic field, and the cans are ejected from the rest of the recyclate stream.</p>

                    <p class="collection-text">Finally, glass must be sorted by hand based on its color: brown, amber, green or clear.</p>

                    <h3>Recycling industrial waste</h3>


                    <p class="collection-text">Although many government programs are concentrated on recycling at home, a large portion of waste is generated by industry. The focus of many recycling programs done by industry is the cost-effectiveness of recycling. The ubiquitous
                        nature of cardboard packaging makes cardboard a commonly recycled waste product by companies that deal heavily in packaged goods, like retail stores, warehouses, and distributors of goods. Other industries deal in niche or specialized
                        products, depending on the nature of the waste materials that are present.</p>

                    <p class="collection-text">The glass, lumber, wood pulp, and paper manufacturers all deal directly in commonly recycled materials. However, old rubber tires may be collected and recycled by independent tire dealers for a profit.</p>

                    <p class="collection-text">Levels of metals recycling are generally low. In 2010, the International Resource Panel, hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) published reports on metal stocks that exist within society and their recycling rates.
                        The Panel reported that the increase in the use of metals during the 20th and into the 21st century has led to a substantial shift in metal stocks from below ground to use in applications within society above ground. For example,
                        the in-use stock of copper in the USA grew from 73 to 238 kg per capita between 1932 and 1999.</p>

                    <p class="collection-text">The report authors observed that, as metals are inherently recyclable, the metals stocks in society can serve as huge mines above ground. However, they found that the recycling rates of many metals are very low. The report warned that
                        the recycling rates of some rare metals used in applications such as mobile phones, battery packs for hybrid cars and fuel cells, are so low that unless future end-of-life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical
                        metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology.</p>

                    <p class="collection-text">The military recycles some metals. The U.S. Navy's Ship Disposal Program uses ship breaking to reclaim the steel of old vessels. Ships may also be sunk to create an artificial reef. Uranium is a very dense metal that has qualities
                        superior to lead and titanium for many military and industrial uses. The uranium left over from processing it into nuclear weapons and fuel for nuclear reactors is called depleted uranium, and it is used by all branches of the
                        U.S. military use for armour-piercing shells and shielding.</p>

                    <p class="collection-text">The construction industry may recycle concrete and old road surface pavement, selling their waste materials for profit.</p>

                    <p class="collection-text">Some industries, like the renewable energy industry and solar photovoltaic technology in particular, are being proactive in setting up recycling policies even before there is considerable volume to their waste streams, anticipating
                        future demand during their rapid growth</p>

                        <p>They are said to be much faster than normal methods of composting. When green waste is properly composted
                            at home, it doesn't give off methane, a gas which contributes to climate change.</p>
                        <p>The leftover compost can then be used in gardens and to plant houseplants which in turn create oxygen.

                    <p> UK households produced 30.5 million tonnes of waste in 2003/04, of which 17% was collected for recycling (source: defra.gov.uk). This figure is still quite low compared to some of our neighbouring EU countries, some recycling over
                        50% of their waste. There is still a great deal of waste which could be recycled that ends up in landfill sites which is harmful to the environment. Recycling is an excellent way of saving energy and conserving the environment. </p>
