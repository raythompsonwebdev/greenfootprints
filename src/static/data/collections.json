    "text": "Curbside collection encompasses many subtly different systems,which differ mostly on where in the process the recyclates are sorted and cleaned. The main categories are mixed waste collection, commingled recyclables and source separation. A waste collection vehicle generally picks up the waste. \n\nAt one end of the spectrum is mixed waste collection, in which all recyclates are collected mixed in with the rest of the waste, and the desired material is then sorted out and cleaned at a central sorting facility. \n\nThis results in a large amount ofrecyclable waste, paper especially, being too soiled to reprocess, but has advantages as well: the city need not pay for a separate collection of recyclates and no public education is needed. \n\nAny changes to which materials are recyclable is easy to accommodate as all sorting happens in a central location.",

This greatly reduces the need for post-collection cleaning but does require public education on what materials are recyclable. Source separation is the other extreme, where each material is cleaned and sorted prior to collection. \n\nThis method requires the least post-collection sorting and produces the purest recyclates, but incurs additional operating costs for collection of each separate material. \n\nAn extensive public education program is also required, which must be successful if recyclate contaminationis to be avoided.",

This is done in a series of stages, many of which involve automated processes such that a truck-load of material can be fully sorted in less than an hour. \n\nSome plants can now sort the materials automatically, known as single-stream recycling. \n\nA 30 percent increase in recycling rates has been seen in the areas where these plants exist. Initially, the commingled recyclates are removed from the collection vehicle and placed on a conveyor belt spread out in a single layer. \n\nLarge pieces of corrugated fiberboard and plastic bags are removed by hand at this stage, as they can cause later machinery to jam.",

Cardboard is removed from the mixed paper, and the most common types of plastic, PET (#1) and HDPE (#2), are collected. \n\nThis separation is usually done by hand, but has become automated in some sorting centers: a spectroscopic scanner is used to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic based on the absorbed wavelengths, and subsequently divert each material into the proper collection channel. \n\nStrong magnets are used to separate out ferrous metals, such as iron, steel, and tin-plated steel cans (\"tin cans\"). \n\nNon-ferrous metals are ejected by magnetic eddy currents in which a rotating magnetic field induces an electric current around the aluminium cans, which in turn creates a magnetic eddy current inside the cans. This magnetic eddy current is repulsed by a large magnetic field, and the cans are ejected from the rest of the recyclate stream. Finally, glass must be sorted by hand based on its color: brown, amber, green or clear.",
